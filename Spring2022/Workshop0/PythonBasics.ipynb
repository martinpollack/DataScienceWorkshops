    "Jupyter Notebooks consist of two kinds of blocks, or groupings of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"code\" blocks you can write your actual Python code, and outputs coming from your code are printed out nicely at the end of each block. To run your code, just hit the \"play button\" or right-pointing arrow in the upper left corner of a selected code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are also \"markdown\" blocks where you can write normal text to describe or give context for your code, like the one you are reading right now! There are lots of things you can do in these to customize your text, but we will only briefly discuss one of them: headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you put a single \"#\" before text, it will be a large header\n",
    "## With two \"#\" symbols, you get a medium-sized header\n",
    "### Three of them means you get a small header\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks can be edited by double-clicking on them. They can be deleted by double-clicking on them and then clicking on the trash can icon in the top-right corner of the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create new blocks by clicking on the block you want to be before your new one and then selecting either \"+ Code\" or \"+ Text\" in the top-left corner of Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
