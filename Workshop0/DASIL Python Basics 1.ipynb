    "\n",
    "Then there are also \"markdown\" blocks for writing normal text to describe or give context for your code, like the one you are reading right now! There are lots of things you can do here to customize your text, but we will only briefly discuss one of them: headers.\n",

    "# If you put a single \"#\" before text, it will be a large header\n",
    "## With two \"#\" symbols, you get a medium-sized header\n",

    "Blocks can be deleted by double-clicking on them and then clicking on the trash can icon in the top-right corner of the block.\n",
